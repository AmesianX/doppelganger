## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is a peer to peer standard proposal from Google allowing
browsers to connect directly and transfer information without a
central server. This allows browsers to share raw data as well as
audio/video.

There's also a great overview on the
[Mozilla Blogs about WebRTC and associated technologies](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/webrtc-and-the-ocean-of-acronyms/)
